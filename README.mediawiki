'''''JChemPaint''''' (or JCP for short here) is the editor and viewer for 2D chemical structures developed using [http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/cdk/index.php?title=Main_Page CDK].
It is implemented in several forms: a Java application and two varieties of Java applet.

Please see the documentation at
https://github.com/JChemPaint/jchempaint/wiki
for more information.

The issue tracker here (on top of this page) is for specific
JCP-related bugs. For problems in CDK proper, please use
