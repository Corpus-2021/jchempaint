<h1>  JChemPaint Tutorial</h1>
<h3> General Usage</h3>
<p>The general idea is that while using JChemPaint, the program always is in a 
"drawing mode". This means that clicks somewhere on the panel will draw a certain 
chemical entity. Examples for "drawing modes" are "single bond" or "Carbon atom". 
Drawing modes can be changed by the buttons or via menus. In 
addition to changing the mode, choosing a button or a menu item do also changes 
the currently selected items (if any). Context menus (which appear right clicking 
on the panel) change the element (atom, bond) on which you clicked for the 
menu. Apart from these "mode changes", there are also some buttons/menu items, 
which do a one-off action, but have no mode. Examples are "Cut" or "Generate 
Smiles". Keeping this in mind, we now show you how to create a molecule.</p>

<h3> Creating Molecules</h3>
<p>When JChemPaint has been started, you automatically get an empty document.
 In order to paint a structure the typical steps would be the following:
<ul><li>Often it is the best to start with rings. Using the ring templates in
the button bar (<img img src="../../small-bin/triangle.gif">, <img img src="../../small-bin/square.gif"> etc.) you can build the
ring structures of the molecule. Click on a ring button (you switched to "Draw 
x-membered ring mode") and then in the document. You can dock a ring to another ring by clicking
 on an existing ring (the docking atom or bond will be highlighted while hovering over it). If the molecule
has no rings, go to the next step.</li>
<li>The next step are typically the chains. Choose the
<img src="../../small-bin/bond.gif"> button (your are in "single bond mode" then), click on the atom where the chain
starts and then on the last atom of the chain to enlarge it. There are several 
ways to draw bonds in this mode:
  <ul>
   <li>Directly click on an atom: A bond with default length will be drawn at a reasonable angle.</li>
   <li>Drag from an atom: A bond with default length will be drawn at the angle to drag to. This makes it possible to exactly control the direction.</li>
   <li>Drag from an atom to another atom: A bond with default length will be drawn at the angle to drag to.</li>
 </ul>
</li>
<li>After this, you can add double/triple bonds by using
<img src="../../small-bin/bond.gif"> again and clicking on the bonds to make
double or triple. You can use <img src="../../small-bin/up_bond.gif"> and
<img src="../../small-bin/down_bond.gif"> to make existing bonds wedge bonds or
you can draw wedge bonds directly by clicking on an existing atom. The "wedge bond 
mode" works same as the "singel bond mode" with respect to dragging etc., just 
that the bonds created are wedges.</li>
<li>Finally the atoms need to be set. Either use one of the symbol buttons ("Element X mode") and
click on an atom to change it to this symbol. For single-letter elements, you can 
also just hit the key while an atom is highlighted. So to set all the Oxygens in your 
molecule, hover over the atoms one after the other and hit "O" each time. 
You can also use the periodic
table <img src="../../small-bin/element.gif"> to choose an element. With
 <img src="../../small-bin/plus_one.gif"> and
 <img src="../../small-bin/min_one.gif"> you can change the charge.</li>
</ul>
Obviously the mentioned steps are only a suggestion.
You can do them in any order. Have a look through the menus to see what is available 
or read the <a href="referenceGuide.html">Reference Guide</a>.</p>
