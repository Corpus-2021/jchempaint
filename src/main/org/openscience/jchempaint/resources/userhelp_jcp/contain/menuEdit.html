<h2>The Edit Menu</h2>

<h3>Undo</h3>
 <p>Recovers the state of the frame before the last operation that you did.</p>

<h3>Undo</h3>
 <p>Re-does the last undo.</p>

<h3>New (applet only)</h3>
 <p>Cleans the document (in the standalone up, there is a New item in the File
  menu).</p>

<h3>Cut Selected</h3>
 <p>Removes the selected part from the model.</p>

<h3>Select all</h3>
 <p>Selects and marks all atoms in the molecule, so that it can be rotated,
 moved, deleted, etc. This is a useful way to recover parts of the molecule
 that are outside the display area - select all, go into move mode and
 move the molecule using a visible part of it.</p>

<h3>Hydrogens</h3>
<h4>Add Implicit Hydrogens</h4>
<p>JCP can run in two different modes with respect to implicit hydrogens. You can 
switch between them here. The two modes are:
 <ul>
<li>Tracking of Implicit Hydrogens on: JCP will update atoms on which anything (e. g. charge, symbol) 
gets changed, for their 
implicit H count, so that atoms will always be fully saturated.</li>
<li>Tracking of Implicit Hydrogens off: No implicit hydrogens will get added. 
You need to take care of hydrogens yourself, if you want any.</li></ul>
Note that:
 <ul>
 <li>Switching between modes will not change hydrogen count, i. e. if switching off 
 implicit hydrogens will stay and future changes will lead to wrong counts, whereas 
 switching on will not add hydrogens on existing atoms, only new/changed atoms 
 will get the correct count.</li>
 <li>The implicit hydrogens will be only visible when the option "Show
 implicit hydrogens when the atom symbol is shown" is selected in View ->
 Options (default: on). For which atoms the symbols are visible is controlled by
  other settings here.</li>
 <li>You can set hydrogen count of individual atoms via the context menu of the 
 atom (item Properties). This can be used on difficult configurations.</li>
 <li>Whether or not the hydrogens will be contained in an exported file.
 Depends on the file format.(e.g. CML has got implicit Hs, mol has not).
 </li>
 </ul>
 The following menu options allow manipulations of the implicit Hs.
 </p>
<h4>Make Hydrogens Explicit</h4>
 <p>This will transform implicit hydrogens to
 separate atoms connected by a single bond. This will only have an effect if you
  are in implicit mode (see "Add Implicit Hydrogens")</p>
<h4>Make Hydrogens Implicit</h4>
 <p>This will delete bonds to hydrogens and add hydrogens directly to their
 parent atoms as implicit hydrogens.</p>
<h4>Update Implicit Hydrogen Count</h4>
 <p>This will set the implicit hydrogens on all atoms to satisfy valency. This can be
 called in both modes. If tracking of implicit Hs is off, this will only have a one-off 
 effect.</p>

<p>
<h3>Adjust Bond Orders</h3>
 <p>Sets the order of all bonds so that every atom is saturated.</p>

<h3>Reset Bond Orders</h3>
 <p>Sets the order of all bonds to single.</p>

<h3>Clean Up</h3>
 <p>This changes coordinates of atoms and length of bonds to standard
 representation.</p>

<h3>Model Properties</h3>
 <p>Changes properties for this frame. Current properties are: author
 (who generated this model), generation date and software. Additionally,
 a CAS number and checksum can be given.</p>
