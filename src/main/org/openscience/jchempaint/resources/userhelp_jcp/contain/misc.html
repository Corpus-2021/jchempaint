<h2>Setting the GUI language</h2>
<p>TODO this does not work, mention -Duser.language=de and perhaps make language settable in GUI<br>
The file ${HOME}/.jchempaint/properties has two properties with which 
your local language can be set:</p>
<pre>Locale_language = nl</pre>
<pre>Locale_country = NL</pre>
   
<p>This particular example sets the language to Dutch (nl_NL). The default 
language is English (en_US).</p>

<h2>Finding and Reporting bugs</h2>
<p> Though JChemPaint is already very useful, it is not without errors.
    The development team is too small to make the source code 100% bug-free.
    So, at some stage you will find bugs (apologies for that in advance).
    However, the open source community is known for its quick response to both
    acknowledging, and fixing bugs. The JChemPaint team aims to uphold
    the same standard - which is sometimes a bit difficult as there is
    so much to do. Nevertheless, we appreciate it very much if bugs got reported;
    the JChemPaint team does solve many bugs in each release.</p>

<h3> Starting JChemPaint to get debug information </h3>
<p>Debugging is a lot easier when debug information is supplied along with
   the bug report. JChemPaint can be started to get debug information like this:</p>
   <pre> java -Dcdk.debugging=true -jar jchempaint.jar</pre>
<p>This will create a cdk.log file which can be attached to the bug.</p>
