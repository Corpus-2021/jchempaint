<h2>Setting the GUI language</h2>
<p>The GUI of JChemPaint (menus, messages etc.) is available in several languages. 
By default, the language is taken from platform settings of your computer. If this 
is not possible or your langage does not exist in JCP, English is the default 
language. You can override the settings by starting JChemPaint with a parameter 
-Duser.language=de. The country can be set with -Duser.country=DE. This 
particular example sets the language to German German (de_DE). The default 
language is British English (en_GB).</p>

<h2>Finding and Reporting bugs</h2>
<p> Though JChemPaint is already very useful, it is not without errors.
    The development team is too small to make the source code 100% bug-free.
    So, at some stage you will find bugs (apologies for that in advance).
    However, the open source community is known for its quick response to both
    acknowledging, and fixing bugs. The JChemPaint team aims to uphold
    the same standard - which is sometimes a bit difficult as there is
    so much to do. Nevertheless, we appreciate it very much if bugs got reported;
    the JChemPaint team does solve many bugs in each release. Bug reports can 
    be filed at http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=20024&atid=120024 
    using the category "jchempaint".</p>

<h3> Starting JChemPaint to get debug information </h3>
<p>Debugging is a lot easier when debug information is supplied along with
   the bug report. JChemPaint can be started to get debug information like this:</p>
   <pre> java -Dcdk.debugging=true -jar jchempaint.jar</pre>
<p>This will create a cdk.log file which can be attached to the bug.</p>
